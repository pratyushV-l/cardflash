## Getting Started

Since this project has been made with flutter, it can be installed and used in two way. One way would be to look at the releases folder in the repo, and download it from there.There, you will find a zip folder, which you can unzip, and use it portably, as long it stays in the folder. Another way is to compile it manually, using the Flutter SDK.
